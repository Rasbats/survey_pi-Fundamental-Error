Update (20 Apr 2016)

For compiling standalone:
Copy the following DLLs from 'Releases' to the 'build' folder: freexl.dll, geos_c.dll, proj.dll.(iconv.dll should no longer be needed
as it is part of the OpenCPN 4.2/4.2.1 installation). You also need opencpn.lib (4.2/4.2.1) in the 'build' folder.
I used CMake_gui to help find wxWidgets 3.02.

In 'Releases' is a new Windows compiled version of survey_pi for OpenCPN 4.2/4.2.1

Update (20 Apr 2016):

Included are some extra files to make using survey_pi easier to install and enable testing.

In 'Releases' is a Windows compiled version of survey_pi for OpenCPN 4.2/4.2.1

For Windows use: 
Copy the following DLLs from 'Releases' to the OpenCPN program folder: freexl.dll, geos_c.dll, proj.dll.

Also included are some NMEA files to use for testing survey_pi.

In 'Releases' is a Hydromagic file to test Import.

I have included the 'splite-msvc' folder for those people working with Windows.

Changes (16 Nov 2015):
Rendering is for the active survey only, even if 'Preferences' set up differently (TODO)
Stop/Start works when recording NMEA underway or from the VDR plugin
Trace works, when recording from NMEA (Wait a few seconds to allow build up of data)
Profile works, but you need more than 3 depth records.
Zoom To works
Merge allows copying of soundings to another table
Properties button works sort of. Not sure what properties are needed. The plugin screen shows number of soundings etc.
Grid re-drawn when changing surveys
From 'Preferences' the minimum distance between soundings works

Lots still to do but I hope this version is an improvement.


Original notes:
Survey plugin for OpenCPN
=========================

Uses the excellent Spatialite library from http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/
To browse and organize your data, get https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/spatialite_gui/index and/or https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/spatialite_gis/index

On Windows you need iconv.dll somewhere in your PATH or in OpenCPN's program directory. Get it from https://github.com/downloads/nohal/survey_pi/iconv.dll

To compile on Windows you need iconv - The easiest to get it is to use OSGeo4W - described a bit more in the note bellow.

Note
====

If, in the future, we will want to get all the functionality from spatialite

Compilation on Linux
sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev libproj-dev libfreexl-dev

Compilation on Windows:
Get OSGeo4Win: http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/
Install the following libraries: proj.4, freexl, geos, iconv
If you don't like the default location C:\OSGeo4W, you will have to modify CMakeLists.txt

(20 Apri 2016 - splite-msvc folder contains files which can be used to replace those installed by OSGeo4Win)

Usage on Windows
Copy the following DLLs to the OpenCPN program folder: freexl.dll, geos_c.dll, proj.dll - They can be found in the bin subfolder of your OSGeo4W instalation
