Update (16 Feb 2019)

In 'Releases' is a new Windows compiled version of survey_pi for OpenCPN 5 beta.

To run the v2.1 plugin copy the following DLLs/LIBs from 'Releases 2.1' to the main OpenCPN program folder: freexl.dll, geos_c.dll, iconv.dll, proj.lib.

In 'Releases' is a Hydromagic file (tamar.gmp) to test Import.
In 'Releases' is a NMEA file (tamar.txt) to test Import from a NMEA file or to run using VDR_pi to make an NMEA stream.

For compiling standalone with VisualStudio 2015:

Install OSGeo4W_x86.
Link to the following libraries: freexl_i.lib, geos_c.lib, iconv.lib:
Add OSGeo4W bin to linker folders and the include folder to additional include directories.
Place proj.lib in the build folder (Had to build a new version compiled with VS2015).
Place OpenCPN 5 'opencpn.lib' in the build folder.


Original notes by @nohal:
Survey plugin for OpenCPN
=========================

Uses the excellent Spatialite library from http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/
To browse and organize your data, get https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/spatialite_gui/index and/or https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/spatialite_gis/index

On Windows you need iconv.dll somewhere in your PATH or in OpenCPN's program directory. Get it from https://github.com/downloads/nohal/survey_pi/iconv.dll

To compile on Windows you need iconv - The easiest to get it is to use OSGeo4W - described a bit more in the note bellow.

Note
====

If, in the future, we will want to get all the functionality from spatialite

Compilation on Linux
sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev libproj-dev libfreexl-dev

Compilation on Windows:
Get OSGeo4Win: http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/
Install the following libraries: proj.4, freexl, geos, iconv
If you don't like the default location C:\OSGeo4W, you will have to modify CMakeLists.txt

Usage on Windows
Copy the following DLLs to the OpenCPN program folder: freexl.dll, geos_c.dll, proj.dll - They can be found in the bin subfolder of your OSGeo4W instalation
